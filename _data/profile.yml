  <p>
    I am currently a doctoral student in the Network and Information Technologies (NIT) program
    at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), advised by Prof. Agata Lapedriza.
    As a member of the AIWELL (AI for Human WELL-being) lab, I explore emotion understanding and
    model interpretability in multimodal systems.

    Prior to my PhD, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Universitat de Barcelona.
    I then worked for two years as a Data Scientist at DMD.Solutions, a consulting company focused on
    reliability and safety in the aerospace industry. After that, I completed a Master's in Computer Vision
    at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, where I became increasingly interested in human-centered AI and multimodal systems.

    I am actively collaborating with Northeastern University and the MIT CSAIL Vision Group in Antonio Torralba’s lab.
    As part of this collaboration, I completed two mid-term research visits to both institutions in 2024 and 2025.
    I also contributed to the organization of KDD 2024 in Barcelona and have served as a reviewer for WACV and CVPR 2025.
    I enjoy being involved in the academic community and regularly engage in research, reviewing,
    and event organization activities that support knowledge exchange and collaboration.
