abstract: >-
  Understanding emotional signals in older adults is crucial for designing virtual assistants that support their well-being. However existing affective computing models often face significant limitations: (1) limited availability of datasets representing older adults especially in non-English-speaking populations and (2) poor generalization of models trained on younger or homogeneous demographics. To address these gaps this study...
