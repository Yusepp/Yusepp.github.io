    "summary": "When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. ",

However existing affective computing models often face significant limitations:(1) limited availability of datasets representing older adults especially in non-English-speaking populations and (2) poor generalization of models ",

    "summary": "Interpreting the internal mechanisms of large neural networks remains a main challenge for trustworthy AI. Recent works such as MAIA (a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent) have shown that agent-based systems can iteratively generate and test hypotheses about neuron function without the need for human intervention, which offers a scalable s",
